          "Federated Learning is becoming the norm with growing privacy concerns. NimbleEdge is providing a one-stop solution, which is generic enough for these use-cases and easy to learn for beginners in the field. \n Hopefully it will do to FL what pytorch did to DL. \n\n The community has spent a tremendous amount of time to make it flexible and scalable for all the needs of FL practitioners, both in academia and industry.",
